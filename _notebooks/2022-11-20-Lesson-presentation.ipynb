    "#### What is the goal?\n",
    "- Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an algorithms?\n",
    "- An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the three parts of an algorithm?\n",
    "- Sequencing, selection, and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a sequence?\n",
    "- A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ImageOne](../images/ScreenShot2022-11-28at6.10.59PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a selection?\n",
    "- A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn't go to the gas station.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![ImageTwo](../images/ScreenShot2022-11-28at6.11.33PM.png)\n",

    "#### What is a iteration?\n",
    "- An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work.\n",

    "- First off what is a sequential code statement?\n",
    "    - Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned. The process is executed in order as a whole. After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned their new values. They execute in the order in which they appear in the process.\n",
    "- Sequencing - First step to do- Second step to do - third step to do\n",
    "    - Followed in the order that the code comes in. \n",
    "    - You can put numerical values within variables. You can also put variable values inside other variables\n",
    "        - Ex. grade - 82\n",
    "        - Ex. highScore - currentScore\n",
    "    - Can also store results of operations inside of a variable\n",
    "        - Ex. name - firstName + lastName\n",
    "    - Can store results of a procedure call\n",
    "        - Average - calcAverage (10,20,30) \n",
    "    - Order of operations very important\n",
