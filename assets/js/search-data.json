An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways. | . What are the three parts of an algorithm? . Sequencing, selection, and iteration. . | Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration . | . What is a sequence? . A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. | . . What is a selection? . A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn&#39;t go to the gas station. | . . What is a iteration? . An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work. | . . Hacks .

How do we represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements? . First off what is a sequential code statement? Sequential statements are used in processes to specify how signals are assigned. The process is executed in order as a whole. After all the sequential statements in the process are executed the signals are assigned their new values. They execute in the order in which they appear in the process. | . | Sequencing - First step to do- Second step to do - third step to do Followed in the order that the code comes in. | You can put numerical values within variables.

Antony . Goal: Evaluate expression using arithmetic operator. . Arithmetic operator are language that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operator. . The order of arithmetic operation is the same with mathematic operation(Subtraction first). . Examples of arithmetic operators: . -Addition: a+b -Subtraction: a-b -Multiplication: a*b -Division: a/b -Modulus: a MOD b (a and b can be string or number) . Examples of arithmetic operator in code: . 10 + 5 * 8 / 4 . 20.0 . (10+5) * 8 / 4 . 30.0 . num1 = 10 num2 = 5 num3 = 7 result = num1 + num2 + num3 print(result) . 22 . Modulus operator divides the given numerator by the denominator to find a result,which is finding the remainder for the division(remainder has to an integer). . Operator with MOD have the same sequence with multiplication and division. In python and most programming languages, the syntax of MOD is % . Examples with use of MOD: . num1 = 12 num2 = 25 num3 = 14 result = num1 / 4 * num3 + 9 % 2 - num3 print(result) . 29.0 . num1 = 12 num2 = 25 num3 = 14 result = num2 % num1 * (num3+6) - 10 print(result) . 10 .

Goal: Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using programming language. . Algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, etc. . Sequencing are the steps of task need to be schedule. Selection is the choice between yes and no which refer to true and false in programming language. Iteration is when you need to repeat the same step after selection, whether if it&#39;s true or false. . For example, when you are make an algorithm to count the even number in a list. The code will first get the number, then make the selection if it&#39;s even or not. If the selection is no, then it will run iteration to add 1, after running this number the code will see if there are more numbers to determine and keep looping until all the numbers are turned even, then the computer will display the count. .

Anthony: . Goal: Evaluate expression using arithmetic operator . Arithmetic operator are language that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operator. . The order of the operation is the same as mathematic operation. . Example of operator: a+b grade+10 . multiplications are represent with * divisions are represent with / modulus are represent with MOD(all caps) . Modulus operator give the a result of left over for example, 9 MOD 2. Since 9 divided by 2 is not a whole number. It will evaluate the left over with the closest whole number division which is 8. . The order of arithmetic operator: Division, multiplication and MOD are the greater, then addition and subtraction . For lesson planning: We can do a quiz with example similar to college board. Will we define num1,2,and 3, then put it into a operator with multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and MOD. . Mati: . Goal: Evaluate expression that manipulate strings .

Lesson Planning: . Luka introducing the topic and the table of contents. we are going to present off a notebook that we make before hand. Luka, Saavan, and Antony will read out their parts of the assignment and explain the video in a short summery of each video from section 3.3. After they finish, we will do a fun teaching assignment where the students have to find the correct answer out of other 5 other incorrect answer. This will be five questions long. The student with the most right answer will get a pat on the shoulder. if there is a tie, their fate will be chosen by a tie-breaker question. after the game, Matty will read out his part of the assignment and explain the video in a short summery. After he finishes, we will play a word soup game where all of the vocabulary from section 3.4. The person with the most word found will also get a pat on the shoulder. .",
