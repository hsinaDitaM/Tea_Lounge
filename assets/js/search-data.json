Goal: Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using programming language. . Algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, etc. . Sequencing are the steps of task need to be schedule. Selection is the choice between yes and no which refer to true and false in programming language. Iteration is when you need to repeat the same step after selection, whether if it&#39;s true or false. . For example, when you are make an algorithm to count the even number in a list. The code will first get the number, then make the selection if it&#39;s even or not. If the selection is no, then it will run iteration to add 1, after running this number the code will see if there are more numbers to determine and keep looping until all the numbers are turned even, then the computer will display the count. . For lesson planning: . Saavan: . (insert the ideas, and the video paraphrased.) . Anthony: . Goal: Evaluate expression using arithmetic operator . Arithmetic operator are language that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operator. . The order of the operation is the same as mathematic operation. . Example of operator: a+b grade+10 . multiplications are represent with * divisions are represent with / modulus are represent with MOD(all caps) . Modulus operator give the a result of left over for example, 9 MOD 2. Since 9 divided by 2 is not a whole number. It will evaluate the left over with the closest whole number division which is 8. . The order of arithmetic operator: Division, multiplication and MOD are the greater, then addition and subtraction . For lesson planning: We can do a quiz with example similar to college board. Will we define num1,2,and 3, then put it into a operator with multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and MOD. . Mati: . (insert the ideas, and the video paraphrased.) . .
