(insert the ideas, and the video paraphrased.) . Saavan: . (insert the ideas, and the video paraphrased.) . Anthony: . Goal: Evaluate expression using arithmetic operator . Arithmetic operator are language that use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operator. . The order of the operation is the same as mathematic operation. . Example of operator: a+b grade+10 . multiplications are represent with * divisions are represent with / modulus are represent with MOD(all caps) . Modulus operator give the a result of left over for example, 9 MOD 2. Since 9 divided by 2 is not a whole number. It will evaluate the left over with the closest whole number division which is 8. . The order of arithmetic operator: Division, multiplication and MOD are the greater, then addition and subtraction . For lesson planning: We can do a quiz with example similar to college board. Will we define num1,2,and 3, then put it into a operator with multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and MOD. . Mati: . (insert the ideas, and the video paraphrased.) . .
